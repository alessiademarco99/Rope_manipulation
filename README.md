# First_attempt_with_jit

The goal state is the first mass in position (0,0,0) and the last one in position (4,0,0).
I started with a simple circle constraint on x and y position of the last two masses to see the behaviour of the algorithm, since I already had them implemented.
The jit function is applied to the transition of the state and the speed of the algorithm is improved a lot.
